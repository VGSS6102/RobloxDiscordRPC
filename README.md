## FAQ

1. **How to use**
> Open the exe file and keep it there it should be displayed on your status. (You should turn on activity)

## Note
> This is an inspiration of Bloxstrap.

> This one doesn't have Join server button due to some privacy issue so i didn't build it in there but it was included inside the code, if you actually need to build one just go check the source code or request it from me in Issues.
